## LibDriver SHT4X

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/sht4x/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

SHT4X is a digital sensor platform for measuring relative humidity and temperature at different accuracy classes. Its I2C interface provides several preconfigured I2C addresses while maintaining an ultra-low power budget (0.4 μW). The power-trimmed internal heater can be used at three heating levels thus enabling sensor operation in demanding environments. The four-pin dual-flatno-leads package is suitable for surface mount technology (SMT) processing and comprises an optional on-package patented PTFE membrane or a removable protective cover. Sensor specific calibration certificates according to ISO17025, identifiable through unique serial number, are available.

LibDriver SHT4X is the full function driver of SHT4X launched by LibDriver.It provides functions of temperature and humidity reading and serial number reading. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver SHT4X source files.

/interface includes LibDriver SHT4X IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver SHT4X driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver SHT4X sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver SHT4X offline document.

/datasheet includes SHT4X datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_sht4x_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t num[4];
uint32_t i;
float temperature;
float humidity;

/* basic init */
res = sht4x_basic_init(SHT4X_ADDRESS_0);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 1000ms */
    sht4x_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = sht4x_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (float *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)sht4x_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    sht4x_interface_debug_print("sht4x: %d/%d.\n", (uint32_t)(i + 1), (uint32_t)3);
    sht4x_interface_debug_print("sht4x: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    sht4x_interface_debug_print("sht4x: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity);
}

...
    
/* get serial number */
res = sht4x_basic_get_serial_number(num);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)sht4x_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* output */
sht4x_interface_debug_print("sht4x: serial number is 0x%02X 0x%02X 0x%02X 0x%02X.\n", num[0], num[1], num[2], num[3]);

...
    
/* basic deinit */
(void)sht4x_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
